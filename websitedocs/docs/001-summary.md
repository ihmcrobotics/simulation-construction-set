In the previous tutorial we had a simple pendulum swinging under the action of gravity and slowing down to its equilibrium position due to its damping.  
In this tutorial we will illustrate the action of a controller on joints by forcing the pendulum to keep an horizontal position.  
To this end we will write a simple PID controller that will adjust the torque of the PinJoint at the fulcrum.

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the [Simple Pendulum](https://ihmcrobotics.github.io/simulation-construction-set/docs/000-summary.html) tutorial.
