This tutorial assumes that you have followed the [Quick Start](https://ihmcrobotics.github.io/ihmc-open-robotics-software/docs/quickstarthome.html) guide, know a little about your IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ), and a little about Java. If you do not know how to program in Java, pick up a good book or two. We recommend Bruce Eckel's "Thinking in Java", which can be downloaded for free at [bruceeckel.com](http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ/).
 
In this tutorial, we will create a simple simulation of a simple pendulum. Going through this first tutorial will help familiarize you with the structure of an SCS simulation program, and by the end of the tutorial you should be able to create and simulate simple passive systems with pin joints.
