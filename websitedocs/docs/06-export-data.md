title: Exporting Data
---

SCS allows you to export and import simulation data. 

Run the simulation for a little while, and then set the in point and out point to create the window of data which you wish to save. Select `File->Export Data` on the menu or push the Export Data button: ![ExportData](/img/scs-tutorials/scsExportDataButton.png)

![ExportDialog](/img/scs-tutorials/scsExportDataDialog.png)

From the Export dialog select to save a compressed binary data file and then press the `Export` button. Finally, from the save dialog box, choose the directory where you wish to save the data and enter a filename.

Reload the data by going to `File->Import Data` on the menu or by pushing the Import Data button: ![ImportData](/img/scs-tutorials/scsImportDataButton.png) Choose the file you just saved. The data will be loaded. Note that the buffer size will be the exact same size as the saved data.
